# Routing & Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ **Issue 1: Giveaway & Rewards Pages Opening in New Tab**
**Problem:** Pages were not wrapped with AppLayout, causing inconsistent behavior.

**Solution:**
- Added `AppLayout` wrapper to `Rewards.tsx`
- Giveaway page already had `AppLayout` from previous updates
- Both pages now have consistent sidebar/bottom nav

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Rewards.tsx` - Added AppLayout wrapper with proper header

---

### ✅ **Issue 2: Sidebar Not Showing on Giveaway & Rewards**
**Problem:** Pages weren't using the AppLayout component.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped both pages with `<AppLayout>` component
- Added consistent page headers with:
  - Desktop: Page title + user actions
  - Mobile: Logo + user actions
- Navigation now appears on all protected pages

**Result:**
- Desktop (≥1024px): Sidebar visible on left
- Mobile (<1024px): Bottom nav visible at bottom

---

### ✅ **Issue 3: Profile Link Opens Wrong Page**
**Problem:** Clicking profile in navbar didn't open ProfileSummary page.

**Solution:**
Updated `src/router/routes.ts`:
```typescript
// Before:
{
  path: "/profile",
  name: "Profile",
  component: "Profile",  // Wrong component
}

// After:
{
  path: "/profile",
  name: "Profile",
  component: "ProfileSummary",  // Correct component
  isProtected: true,
}
```

Removed the separate `/profile-summary` route since it's now at `/profile`.

---

### ✅ **Issue 4: ChooseUserName Page Shows Instead of SignUp**
**Problem:** 
- "Get Started" button went to `/chooseusername` (deprecated page)
- Should go directly to `/sign-up` page

**Solution:**
Updated two files:

1. **`src/pages/Onboarding.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Before:
<Link to={"/chooseusername"}>

// After:
<Link to={"/sign-up"}>
```

2. **`src/components/modules/Home/HeroSection.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Before:
<Link to="/onboarding">

// After:
<Link to="/sign-up">
```

Also removed the `/chooseusername` route from `routes.ts` since it's no longer needed.

---

### ✅ **Issue 5: Giveaway Route Configuration**
**Problem:** Routes were confusing with both `/giveaway` and `/giveaways`.

**Solution:**
Updated `src/router/routes.ts`:
```typescript
// Before:
{
  path: "/giveaways",     // Main page
  component: "CommunityGiveaway",
}
{
  path: "/giveaway",      // Details page? Confusing!
  component: "GiveawayDetails",
}

// After:
{
  path: "/giveaway",      // Main page
  component: "CommunityGiveaway",
}
{
  path: "/giveaway/:id",  // Details page with ID parameter
  component: "GiveawayDetails",
}
```

Now the routing is clearer:
- `/giveaway` - Browse all giveaways
- `/giveaway/123` - View specific giveaway details

## Additional Notes

### ChooseUserName Page Status:
- Route removed from router configuration
- Component still exists in codebase (can be deleted if not needed)
- No longer accessible via routing

### Profile Pages:
- `Profile.tsx` - Old profile component (not used)
- `ProfileSummary.tsx` - Current profile component (active at `/profile`)

### Page Layout Pattern:
All protected pages should follow this structure:
```tsx
import AppLayout from '../components/layout/AppLayout';

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <AppLayout>
      <header>{/* Page header */}</header>
      <main>{/* Page content */}</main>
    </AppLayout>
  );
};
```
